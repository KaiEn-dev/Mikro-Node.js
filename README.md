![mikro logo](logo.PNG)
### About The Project
Mikro is the final year project of my bachelors degree. <br/>
Mikro is an online shop builder and manager mobile system. <br/>
This project consists of three big parts: 
- a react web application (online shop)
- a react native mobile application (online shop manager)
- a node backend server application (RESTful API)
### How does Mikro work?
1. Business owners will start by building their online shop using the Mikro mobile application. 
2. Once the online shop is deployed, a link to the website will be provided.
3. Customers can now make purchases through the online shop.
4. Sales can then be managed by the business owner in the same Mikro mobile application.
### About This Repo
This repository only contains the backend server application. <br/>
This node application is a RESTful API server. <br/>
Transferring of resources between a MySQL database and both the react & react native applications are made through this server. The server application and database were deployed to Heroku.
