### About The Project
Mikro is the final year project of my bachelors degree. <br/>
Mikro is an online shop builder and manager mobile system. <br/>
This project consists of three big parts: 
- a react web application (online shop)
- a react native mobile application (online shop manager)
- a node backend server application (RESTful API)
### About This Repo
This repository only contains the backend server application. <br/>
This node application is a RESTful API server. Transferring of resources between a MySQL database and both the react & react native applications are made through this server. The server application and database were deployed to Heroku.
